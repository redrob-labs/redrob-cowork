# Microsoft Entra SSO and SCIM

This guide connects Microsoft Entra ID to an Redrob Work organization for SAML
single sign-on and SCIM user provisioning.

## How Redrob Work is wired

Redrob Work uses Better Auth for the underlying SSO and SCIM protocol handlers, then
wraps them with organization-scoped Redrob Work routes and policy:

| Area | Redrob Work surface | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|---|
| SSO management | `/dashboard/sso`, `/v1/sso`, `/v1/sso/saml`, `/v1/sso/oidc` | One SSO connection per organization. Owners and security admins can create or replace it. |
| SAML callback | `/api/auth/sso/saml2/sp/acs/openwork-sso-<org-id>` | Better Auth consumes the response after Redrob Work validates SAML response policy. |
| SAML metadata | `/api/auth/sso/saml2/sp/metadata?providerId=openwork-sso-<org-id>` | Generated after the SAML connection is saved in Redrob Work. |
| SSO sign-in | `/sso/<org-slug>` | Starts SP-initiated SSO for one organization and redirects to Entra. |
| SCIM management | `/dashboard/scim`, `/v1/scim`, `/v1/scim/token` | Owners and security admins create or rotate an org-scoped SCIM bearer token. |
| SCIM provisioning | `/api/auth/scim/v2` | Supports SCIM user provisioning, updates, and deprovisioning. |

Redrob Work enforces these SAML security settings for organization SSO:

- Signed SAML assertions are required.
- IdP-initiated SAML is accepted only through the org-specific provider ACS URL.
- SAML timestamps are required.
- Deprecated SAML algorithms are rejected.
- SSO login writes an external identity link and just-in-time organization
  membership.
- Email/password sign-in is rejected for users managed by an organization SSO or
  SCIM connection.

Redrob Work does not currently support SCIM Group object provisioning. You can
assign Entra users and groups to the enterprise application for scope, but keep
the Entra group object mapping disabled.

## Prerequisites

- An Redrob Work organization owner or admin with security configuration access.
- A Microsoft Entra account with permission to manage Enterprise applications.
  Microsoft documents this as Cloud Application Administrator, Application
  Administrator, or owner of the service principal for SSO configuration.
- The public Redrob Work web and auth URLs must already be final HTTPS URLs. SAML
  and browser auth cookies should not be validated against temporary HTTP
  origins in production.
- The Redrob Work organization should have the expected email domain configured in
  organization settings before requiring SSO for that domain.
- The Redrob Work organization must have the SSO/Enterprise entitlement enabled.
  Without it, Redrob Work keeps the form editable but rejects save attempts with
  `SSO / SAML requires an Enterprise plan`.

## Create or select the Entra enterprise application

1. Open the Microsoft Entra admin center.
2. Go to **Entra ID** -> **Enterprise apps** -> **All applications**.
3. Select the existing Redrob Work enterprise application, or create a new
   non-gallery enterprise application for Redrob Work.
4. Assign at least one test user or test group under **Users and groups**.

For the Redrob Work Labs test tenant, use:

- **Tenant ID**: `2b853de0-b14b-4433-90be-cced1b963647`
- **Redrob Work SSO domain**: `omaropenworklabs.onmicrosoft.com`
- **Test users**:
  - `omar2@omaropenworklabs.onmicrosoft.com`
  - `omar_redrob.io#EXT#@omaropenworklabs.onmicrosoft.com`
- **Redrob Work organization**: `Omar Azure Test`

As of July 7, 2026, both test users are assigned to the **Redrob Work Labs**
enterprise application in Entra, and the Redrob Work Cloud org has the Enterprise
entitlement needed to save SSO settings.

## Configure SAML SSO

There is a small handoff between Entra and Redrob Work: Redrob Work needs Entra's IdP
values before it can save the connection, and Entra needs Redrob Work's generated
ACS URL before SAML can be fully tested.

1. In the Entra enterprise application, open **Single sign-on** and choose
   **SAML**.
2. In the Entra SAML page, copy these IdP values:
   - **Microsoft Entra Identifier**. Use this as Redrob Work **IdP Issuer URL**.
   - **Login URL**. Use this as Redrob Work **SAML Entry Point**.
   - **Certificate (Base64)**. Paste the PEM certificate into Redrob Work
     **IdP Certificate**.
3. In Redrob Work, open **Dashboard** -> **SSO** and choose **SAML**.
4. Fill the Redrob Work fields:
   - **IdP Issuer URL**: the Entra **Microsoft Entra Identifier**. This is
     the IdP issuer, not the Entra app's Identifier / Entity ID.
   - **Domain**: the email domain that should use this SSO connection, for
     example `example.com`.
   - **SAML Entry Point**: the Entra **Login URL**.
   - **Audience URL**: leave blank to use the Redrob Work auth URL, or enter a
     stable Entity ID that you will also set as the Entra Identifier.
   - **IdP Certificate**: the Entra Base64 certificate as PEM text.
5. Save the SSO connection in Redrob Work.
   - For a custom domain such as `example.com`, request the domain verification
     TXT token in Redrob Work, publish it in DNS, then click **Verify domain**.
   - For Microsoft tenant domains ending in `.onmicrosoft.com`, Redrob Work
     verifies the domain from the matching Entra tenant issuer and SAML entry
     point. You do not need to publish DNS records under Microsoft's
     `onmicrosoft.com` zone.
6. Copy the generated Redrob Work values:
   - **ACS URL**.
   - **Metadata URL**.
   - **Sign-in URL**.
7. Return to Entra **Single sign-on** -> **Basic SAML Configuration** and set:
   - **Identifier (Entity ID)**: the Redrob Work audience. If you left the
     Redrob Work audience blank, use the Redrob Work auth URL shown by your deployment
     docs or metadata. Do not use the Entra `https://sts.windows.net/.../`
     issuer here.
   - **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)**: the Redrob Work **ACS URL**.
   - **Sign on URL**: the Redrob Work **Sign-in URL**.
8. Save the Entra SAML configuration.
9. In Entra **Attributes & Claims**, make sure Redrob Work receives:
   - `email`: the user's email address, usually `user.mail` with fallback to
     `user.userprincipalname` in tenants where `mail` is empty.
   - `displayName`: the user's display name.
   - Name ID: an email-like stable user identifier.
10. Test with an assigned user from the Redrob Work `/sso/<org-slug>` URL or the
    Entra My Apps tile. For multi-org users, the org slug, Entra app, and ACS
    URL choose which Redrob Work organization they are entering.

For the Redrob Work Labs test tenant, the Redrob Work SAML fields are:

- **IdP Issuer URL**:
  `https://sts.windows.net/2b853de0-b14b-4433-90be-cced1b963647/`
- **Domain**: `omaropenworklabs.onmicrosoft.com`
- **SAML Entry Point**:
  `https://login.microsoftonline.com/2b853de0-b14b-4433-90be-cced1b963647/saml2`
- **Audience URL**: leave blank unless you also set a custom Entra Identifier.
  With the field blank, set Entra **Identifier (Entity ID)** to the Redrob Work
  auth URL, not to the `sts.windows.net` issuer.
- **IdP Certificate**: paste the active Entra SAML signing certificate.

## Configure SCIM user and group provisioning

1. In Redrob Work, open **Dashboard** -> **SCIM**.
2. Copy the **SCIM base URL**.
3. Create or rotate the connector token and copy the bearer token immediately.
   Redrob Work only shows it after creation or rotation.
4. In the Entra enterprise application, open **Provisioning**.
5. Set **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.
6. Under **Admin Credentials**, set:
   - **Tenant URL**: the Redrob Work **SCIM base URL**.
   - **Secret Token**: the Redrob Work SCIM bearer token.
7. Select **Test Connection**.
8. Open **Mappings**:
    - Keep user provisioning enabled.
    - Enable group object provisioning when Entra groups should manage Redrob Work teams.
    - Use a matching attribute that Redrob Work can filter by, normally
      `userName` mapped from `userPrincipalName` or `mail`.
9. In Redrob Work, enable **Create teams from SCIM groups** if provisioned groups
   should create and manage matching teams. Leave it off to retain group metadata
   without changing teams.
10. Under **Settings**, choose the scope. For a controlled rollout, sync only
   assigned users and groups.
11. Turn **Provisioning Status** on after the test connection and mappings are
    correct.

## Validation checklist

- Redrob Work's `/sso/<org-slug>` Sign-in URL redirects to Entra for SP-initiated
  SSO.
- Entra My Apps or test launch posts the SAML response to Redrob Work's generated
  ACS URL.
- A first SSO login creates or updates an Redrob Work user and organization member.
- Email/password sign-in is rejected for managed users when SSO is required for
  the organization domain.
- Entra SCIM **Test Connection** succeeds.
- Provisioning an assigned test user creates the Redrob Work user and organization
  membership.
- Provisioning a group creates a matching Redrob Work team when team sync is enabled.
- Removing the assignment retains a disconnected member record. Redrob Work deletes
  the global user only when the user has no other active organization membership.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Entra says the reply URL is invalid | The Entra Reply URL does not match Redrob Work's generated ACS URL | Copy the ACS URL from Redrob Work after saving the SAML connection and paste it into Basic SAML Configuration. |
| Microsoft shows `AADSTS700016` for `https://sts.windows.net/.../` | Entra is receiving the IdP issuer as the SP Entity ID / app identifier | Set Entra **Identifier (Entity ID)** to the Redrob Work audience/auth URL, then resave the SSO connection in Redrob Work so AuthnRequests use the Redrob Work SP Entity ID. |
| SAML login fails with audience or recipient errors | Entra Identifier, Redrob Work Audience URL, or ACS URL do not match | Keep the Entra Identifier equal to the Redrob Work audience and the Entra Reply URL equal to the Redrob Work ACS URL. |
| SAML login fails after changing certs | Redrob Work still has the old IdP certificate | Paste the new Entra Base64 certificate into Redrob Work and save the SAML connection again. |
| IdP-initiated login fails with `unsolicited_response` | The deployment is running an older Redrob Work version that rejects IdP-initiated SAML | Upgrade Redrob Work or start login from Redrob Work's `/sso/<org-slug>` sign-in URL. |
| SCIM test connection is unauthorized | The token was copied incorrectly or rotated after Entra was configured | Rotate the Redrob Work SCIM token and update Entra's Secret Token. |
| Entra group provisioning fails | Redrob Work does not support SCIM Group objects yet | Disable the group object mapping and use group assignment only to scope user provisioning. |
