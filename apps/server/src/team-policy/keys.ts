/*
 * The public keys a team policy may be signed with. Pinned in the build, never fetched: a key list
 * the app downloads would be a second way to get a key trusted, and the one an attacker would aim
 * at. Rotation is two keys deep instead. The console signs with the active key; to rotate it
 * starts signing with the standby key, and the next release pins a new standby.
 *
 * PRODUCTION_KEYS is empty until the console's KMS keys exist (redrob-console K4, then cowork C9),
 * so until then a packaged build accepts no policy at all. TEST_KEYS are accepted only in a
 * development build (REDROB_DEV_MODE=1) or when a test asks for them; their private halves are in
 * ./vectors/test-keys.json, so anyone can sign with them, which is exactly why a packaged build
 * must never trust them.
