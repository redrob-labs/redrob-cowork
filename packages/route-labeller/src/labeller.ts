/*
 * The route labeller: which ModelGuide profession and task a request is, decided on the person's
 * machine and sent to Console as `redrob.route`, which Redrob Auto routes on.
 *
 * Two passes, combined. The embedding pass compares the request with each cell's prototype - the mean
 * of its example sentences in English, Korean and Hindi - so "이 계약서 좀 봐줘" lands on contract
 * review without the words matching any list. The lexical pass, the same one the Console API runs on
 * unlabelled requests, adds what the words say outright. Either alone is weaker: the encoder blurs
 * neighbouring tasks of one profession, the word list misses anything phrased its own way.
 *
 * Local by construction. The text never leaves the machine for this; only the two ids and the
 * runners-up are sent, alongside a prompt that was going to Console anyway.
